Script:

main_all.m: It is the main script which run all the below mentioned codes, whose results are used in Chapter 3 of the thesis("Diss_Kumar_Pawan.pdf" present in the parent directory). 

The arrangement of codes and results:

1. Full_model_I_II (figure 3.2 and 3.3) : this directory contains the codes and results for experiments 1 and 2 mentioned in the 3rd Chapter of the thesis.


2. Difference_minimal (Figure 3.4): the codes & results in this directory are for the difference between the full model and the old model (e.g glioma density full model - glioma density minimal/old model) (in the framework of experiment 2).

3. Difference_self_diffusion (figure 3.5): in this directory the codes and simulation represent the comparison(by difference) between the full model and the model without limited flux for glioma self diffusion(gamma_2 = 0, the denominator of ph_taxis = 1, in the framework of experiment 2)


4. Pattern (figure 3.6: first and second row): this folder contains contain the 1D codes and videos for the full system in  dimensional form, also the results for pattern formations 

5. Pattern_difference(figure 3.7) : the pattern difference between old and new model (experiment 3 in 1D)

6. Pattern_diff_W_L_flux (figure 3.6: 3rd to 6th row): the pattern formed by without self diffusion model and the difference between full model and without self diff model.
