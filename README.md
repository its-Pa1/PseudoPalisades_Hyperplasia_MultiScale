# Repository Overview

Welcome to this GitHub repository, which houses the code corresponding to the article titled "A Flux-Limited Model for Glioma Patterning with Hypoxia-Induced Angiogenesis", DOI: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/11/1870. The results are used in Chapter 3 of the thesis: https://kluedo.ub.rptu.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/6573.

## Key Features

The codebase encompasses a variety of functionalities, including:

- Full model simulations
- Comparison between different models
- Pattern formation analysis

## Project Structure

### Scripts

The main script `main_all.m` runs all the below-mentioned codes, whose results are used in Chapter 3 of the thesis ("Diss_Kumar_Pawan.pdf" present in the parent directory).

### Full_model_I_II (figure 3.2 and 3.3)

This directory contains the codes and results for experiments 1 and 2 mentioned in the 3rd Chapter of the thesis.

### Difference_minimal (Figure 3.4)

The codes & results in this directory are for the difference between the full model and the old model (e.g., glioma density full model - glioma density minimal/old model) in the framework of experiment 2.

### Difference_self_diffusion (figure 3.5)

In this directory, the codes and simulation represent the comparison (by difference) between the full model and the model without limited flux for glioma self-diffusion (gamma_2 = 0, the denominator of ph_taxis = 1) in the framework of experiment 2.

### Pattern (figure 3.6: first and second row)

This folder contains the 1D codes and videos for the full system in dimensional form, also the results for pattern formations.

### Pattern_difference (figure 3.7)

The pattern difference between the old and new model (experiment 3 in 1D).

### Pattern_diff_W_L_flux (figure 3.6: 3rd to 6th row)

The pattern formed by the model without self-diffusion and the difference between the full model and the model without self-diffusion.
